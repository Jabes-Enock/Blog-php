To organize our application, we have some folders where specific files are.</p>

- **Componentes:** This folder is where the components are, which are used a lot in our application.
  <br>

- **Conex√£o:** Inside there is a file conexao.php that is responsible for connecting to the database.
  <br>

- **CSS:** Responsible for styling, and as we are working with tailwindcss we have all the necessary classes here.
<br>

- **img:** Folder where all post images will be stored.
<br>

- **PHP:** PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

- **Tailwind:** Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override
